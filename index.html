							<h3>FAQ</h3>
							<h4>What is a hackathon?</h4>
<p>Started in Silicon Valley in 1999 to foster growth in the software development community, hackathons bring together software developers from all different industries to work on projects which center around specific themes. The goal is to develop creative solutions to invent new products or improve existing products. Much of the Twitter and Facebook functionality is the result of hackathon formatted events.
</p>
<h4>How does a hackathon work?</h4>
<p>A hackathon is typically a 24 - 48 hour event where different groups present problems they are trying to solve. Attendees choose what they want to work on based on the presentations. Small groups form together to develop a specific product(s) inside the time box of the event. The event culminates in a closing ceremony where attendees present what has been created.
</p>
<h4>Do I have to register for all of the educational opportunities to participate in the hackathon?</h4>
<p>No, the educational opportunities are designed to build your agency’s knowledge base of existing tools and strategies that can help your agency accomplish its mission.  We encourage you to participate in the opportunities that will meet your agency’s needs.  Although registration is not required to submit a proposal for the hackathon, we encourage all agencies considering a proposal to register for the design thinking workshop and coaching calls to help develop and refine proposals for the hackathon.  
</p>
<h4>Can any Middle Tennessee based non-profit participate in the hackathon?</h4>
<p>The HCA Foundation and other Hack for the Community partners maintain close relationships with more than 200 organizations in Middle Tennessee which closely reflect our mission and values. Hack for the Community is intended to specifically serve a small subset of those well-established relationships. If you are uncertain of your eligibility, please contact Caitlin.Nossett@hcahealthcare.com.
</p>
<h4>Can someone help me determine an idea so I can participate in the event?</h4><p>
The design thinking educational opportunity was developed to help agencies think creatively about solutions to problems.  In June, agencies will have the opportunity to participate in coaching calls to help develop and refine ideas for proposals.  Our coaches will help you refine your ideas.
</p>
<h4>I already have an idea, how do I submit it?</h4><p>We strongly encourage all agencies considering participation in the hackathon to register for a coaching call to refine their ideas prior to submission.  Agencies can submit their ideas via the submission form on hackforthecommunity.com June 1 – July 1, 2016.
</p>

<h4>Will experts familiar with the technology we use participate in the hackathon?</h4>
<p>We are seeking to attract a wide range of experts in Microsoft and open source technologies.
</p>
<h4>How can I determine if an idea is achievable inside the 36 hour time box?</h4>
<p>Selecting projects requires the careful consideration of our event coordinators. Helping you answer this question is a key objective of the coaching calls that will take place in June.
</p>
<h4>What do I do if I have more than one idea?</h4>
<p>We encourage our non-profit partners to formulate several strong, concise ideas. Our coaches will work with you to find one idea which has the highest likelihood of success within the 36 hour time box of the event.
</p>
<h4>What are a few good and bad examples of projects to undertake at this event?</h4>
<p>In most cases, the creation of a simple web site or mobile application is achievable. Creating a social media strategy, “skinning” Twitter and Facebook profiles, or setting up Google Analytics would be achievable. Setting up a blog, a CRM, or an email marketing system would be achievable in most situations. Adding, modifying, or removing functionality on an existing web site or mobile application can be problematic inside a 36-hour time box. Anything related to physical hardware, networking, or cabling — such as setting-up or configuring a phone systems or server — would not be an ideal project for this event. Please see “Past Hackathon Grantees” for examples of previous projects.
</p>
<h4>How will I know if my idea has been selected for the event?</h4>
<p>You will receive a notification by August 1st if your agency has been selected to participate. 
</p>
<h4>If my idea is selected, what happens next?</h4>
<p>If your agency is selected to participate, you will meet your team of volunteers in early September to develop the scope of your project and identify additional information and skill sets needed. 
</p>
<h4>I don’t know how to manage a technology project, can someone help me?</h4>
<p>>A project manager will be assigned to your project for the hackathon.</p>
<h4>
Is it guaranteed that people will volunteer to help me?</h4>
<p>If your idea is selected, you will have the opportunity to present your idea to a few volunteers at the September pre-hackathon meeting. Additional volunteers will be recruited to serve at the hackathon. At the beginning of the hackathon, you will have the opportunity to pitch your idea to the additional volunteers. We recommend you take great care in presenting your idea to pique the interest of volunteers so that they align with your project. 
</p>
<h4>Will the expert volunteers be available to help me when the event is over?</h4>
<p>A key objective of Hack for the Community is to create lasting relationships between technical and creative professionals with the non-profit community. Your expectation should be that if any professional offers their assistance during the event, they are doing so on a voluntary basis with the understanding that their contribution is time boxed to 36 hours. However, it would not be unusual for a lasting connection to be made and continue outside the event.
</p>
<h4>What do I need to do to ensure my idea is clear and my project is a success?</h4>
<p>Through coaching calls, our coaches will help you refine your idea.  Prior to the coaching call, we recommend that you attend the design thinking educational workshop and work with your internal team to develop your proposal.
</p>
<h4>Will I need to attend the event over all 36 hours?</h4>
<p>Volunteers who favor your idea and choose to work alongside you will assess the level of effort necessary to complete your idea. Your team will identify its own schedule inside the 36 hour window. If someone from your volunteer team is working on your idea, a representative from your agency should be onsite and supporting them.
</p>
<h4>What can I do to show my appreciation to volunteers?</h4>
<p>Working alongside your volunteers demonstrates that you appreciate their effort. If you aren’t able to contribute to the technical or creative exercises they are undergoing, be sure they are well fed and hydrated and have what they need to get the job done. Share with your volunteers an example of how you anticipate their work will help benefit the Middle Tennessee community and keep in communication with them after the event to let them know about the impacts of their work.

					The challenges that the less fortunate in Middle Tennessee are facing everyday are evolving — and the solutions will require creativity and innovation.   We recognizes that it takes more than just financial contributions to make change.  Finding elegant solutions takes inspiration, it takes ideas, and it takes a team.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-4">
						<p>Today, it usually takes technology too. HCA and Nashville Technology Council are excited to announce the 2016 Hack for the Community, a program that brings together Nashville's best IT professionals for the singular purpose of building the technological capacity of local nonprofits and developing solutions to community problems.</p></div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
						<div id="slide" class="collapse">
							<p>Unlike other civic or non-profit hackathons, Hack for the Community has the financial backing of The HCA Foundation, benefits from the business partnerships of HCA and Nashville Technology Council, and has partnered with Hack Tennessee producers Avery Fisher and Brendan Wovchko.  This combination ensures that the best ideas will be connected with organizations that can powerfully leverage them to help people throughout Middle Tennessee.</p>
<p>Non-profits will be selected by Hack for the Community partners.  Event producers will coach non-profits in identifying the "right size needs" for the event, solicit solutions from Nashville's community of visual designers and software developers, and facilitate the matching of volunteers and projects during the event.</p>
<p>The event will conclude with a hacker’s choice ceremony, where the crowd favorite will receive $2,500 in additional financial support for the continued development of their idea.</p>
