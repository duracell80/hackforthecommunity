				<h2>ABOUT HACK FOR THE COMMUNITY</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="container text">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-2">
						<p>The challenges that the less fortunate in Middle Tennessee are facing everyday are evolving — and the solutions will require creativity and innovation.   The HCA Foundation recognizes that it takes more than just financial contributions to make change.  Finding elegant solutions takes inspiration, it takes ideas, and it takes a team.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-4">
						<p>Today, it usually takes technology too. The HCA Foundation is excited to announce Hack for the Community, a 36-hour gathering of Nashville's best visual designers and software developers for the singular purpose of building technology for local agencies that will make an immediate impact on our community.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
						<div id="slide" class="collapse">
							<p>Unlike other civic or non-profit hackathons Hack for the Community has the financial backing of The HCA Foundation, benefits from the deeply-rooted history HCA has established with many of Nashville's most effective non-profits, and has partnered with Hack Nashville producers Avery Fisher and Brendan Wovchko.  This combination ensures that the best ideas will be connected with organizations who can most powerfully leverage them to help people throughout Middle Tennessee.</p>
							<p>Non-profits will be selected from The HCA Foundation's pool of non-profit organizations.  Event producers will coach non-profits in identifying the "right size needs" for the event, solicit solutions from Nashville's community of visual designers and software developers, and facilitate the matching of volunteers and projects during the event.</p>
							<p>The event will conclude with a hackers choice ceremony, where the crowd favorite will receive $2,500 in additional financial support for the continued development of their idea.</p>
